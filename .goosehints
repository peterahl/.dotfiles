This is a Git-based dotfiles project used to manage your development environment configuration, including shell settings (zsh), tmux, and various other tools.

GNU Stow is used to manage symlinks. Running `stow .` is only necessary when a *new* file or directory has been added to the project. Symlinks for existing files are automatically updated when the files themselves are modified.

Key Files & Directories:
- .zshrc (shell configuration)
- .tmux.conf (tmux configuration)
- .aliases (optional: shell aliases - create if needed)
- .local/bin/ (location for custom scripts)

If you choose to use shell aliases, create a file named `.aliases` in the project. This file will be sourced by your `.zshrc`.

Workflow: Edit files, then run `stow .` to update symlinks (only when adding new files or directories).

The project is managed with Git, and you may ask me to use Git commands for diffing, committing, and other version control tasks.
